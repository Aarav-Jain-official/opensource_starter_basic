## DON'T PANIC

This session may be difficult for beginners to solve. The main purpose of this session is to not teach you to do the things you already know but to teach you what to do when you don't know anything about the stuff that you are working on 



## STRUCTURE


1) This is the chill repo. You have to first explore the website.
2) Think what would you want more in that website if you were using it on a daily basis
3) Create a issue of whatever you think could be improved
4) Solve that issue and merge the request


#### The marking would be incremental meaning we will provide you marks for how close you got to the actual solution as well.


## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE ?

1) Set the project up locally by following the instructions in README.md
2) Create a new branch on which you will be commiting all your changes
3) After you are done push the changes to the remote forked repository in the new branch that you created
4) Navigate to the repository page on github and click the button that says Compare and Pull Request
5) Write the description of your solution according to the template 
6) Create a pull request
